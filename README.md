✔️ Bot Response: The application features a basic bot that replies to user messages.

✔️ Custom Username: Users can set their name, and messages appear with their chosen username.

✔️ Chat Styling: Messages are displayed in a structured chat format, with timestamps.

✔️ Clear Chat: A button allows users to erase the chat history.
